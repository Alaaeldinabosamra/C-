In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#, a static method is a method that belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class.
This means that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class. 
Static methods are used for operations that do not require any data from an instance of the class and can be shared across all instances.

1. Belong to the Class: Static methods belong to the class rather than any particular object instance.
2. Cannot Access Instance Members: Static methods cannot access instance variables or instance methods directly. They can only access static members (both variables and methods) of the class.
3. Called on the Class: Static methods are called on the class itself, not on objects of the class.
